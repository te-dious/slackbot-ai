TDD Credit endorsement

Introduction

The current endorsement process for VMI (pre-paid and post-paid credit) flow is done manually by OPS and Finance. This results in 

several pain points, including a lack of support for returning money via netting credit invoices and manual adjustments made by Finance 

for endorsement cases.

The objective of this project is to automate the VMI endorsement process and address the identified pain points.

Problem Statement

Currently, the endorsement process for VMI (pre-paid and post-paid credit) flow is done manually by OPS and Finance, which results in 

several pain points. These include a lack of support for returning money via netting credit invoices, manual adjustments made by Finance 

for endorsement cases, and a lack of a place to store endorsed policies on the portal. Additionally, the existing cancellation flow only 

supports certain types of cancellations. These manual processes lead to inefficiencies, errors, and increased time for customers to receive 

their service. The problem is that the current system does not have the capability to automate the VMI endorsement process, resulting in a 

time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient process. This request aims to address these pain points by automating the VMI endorsement 

process, providing support for netting credit invoices, storing endorsed policies on the portal, and modifying the cancellation flow to support 

VMI cancellation but leave just CMI.

Goals

1. Engineering Excellence

a. Reduction of efforts needed for endorsement of a credit sale.

b. Simplifying rollout steps for credit endorsement.

Feature Scope

1. Endorsement initiation: Allows admins to initiate endorsements for VMI policies, including pre-paid and post-paid credit.

2. Netting credit invoice: Automatically creates netting credit invoices for endorsement cases, providing support for adjusting money via 

netting credit invoices.

3. Policy storage: Provides a place to store endorsed policies on the portal, eliminating the need for manual storage on Google Drive.

4. Cancellation support: Modified cancellation flow to support VMI cancellation but leave just CMI.

5. User interface: Includes a user-friendly interface that allows admins to initiate endorsements and view the status of their requests, as 

well as allows OPS and Finance to view and approve endorsements, access updated policy information, and view netting credit 

invoices.

Platform/Business Scope

The scope of the project:

1. The new module will be integrated with the existing invoicing and credit system to support netting credit invoices.

2. It will be available for operations and finance teams.

3. It will cover the VMI flow (pre-paid credit and post-paid credit) only.

4. The change will improve the accuracy of credit invoice information, and provide easy access to endorsed policies on the portal, which 

will lead to a more efficient and streamlined process.

5. It will help to improve customer satisfaction by providing faster service and reducing manual errors.

6. The new module is designed to be scalable, so it can be adjusted to company's future needs.

Solution

1. Disable the refund type options for FairDee to CBC and Insurer to CBC when the sale is a post-paid credit sale, a conditional statement 

will be added to the endorsement window. This statement will check the type of sale and if it is a post-paid credit sale, the options for 

FairDee to CBC and Insurer to CBC will be disabled.

2. To create a refund-type option for Credit Invoice when the sale is a post-paid credit sale, a new option will be added to the refund type 

drop-down menu in the endorsement window. This option will be labeled "Credit Invoice" and will be available only when the sale is a 

post-paid credit sale.

3. To adjust the financial information based on the "Netting at Credit Invoice" option, the following steps will be taken:

a. When the admin user selects the "Netting at Credit Invoice" option and the finance team approves the endorsement or cancellation, 

a new row will be added to the credit invoice. This row will include the amount that has been adjusted after the finance approval. 

(which will be similar to the invoice details of the endorsement invoice).

b. The new row will be displayed based on the date that Finance approves the endorsement. If they are in the same invoice cycle, the 

transaction will be displayed right after the original purchase. If they are not in the same cycle, the row will be sorted based on the 

original sale purchase date.

c. The column name "Cancellation fee" will be changed to "Cancellation/Endorsement fee" and will record the positive value of the 

cancellation fee.

4. Show 2 options for refund type at the endorsement window for a pre-paid credit sale, 2 options will be added to the endorsement 

window. The first option will be labeled "FairDee to CBC". The second option will be labeled "Insurer to CBC". These options will be 

available only when the sale is a pre-paid credit sale.

5. Other related flows will be the same as the existing VMI endorsement process.
