Appman integration

Introduction: The AppMan OCR system is designed to digitize customer data by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to 

scan and extract information from image files. This system provides a quick and efficient way to convert physical documents into digital 

data, making it easier to store, manage, and access customer information.

The AppMan OCR system scans image files and extracts the required information, such as name, address, and other personal details.

Document Acceptance Criteria: 

Car Registration Document: The platform accepts both real and photocopied versions of the Car Registration document. The images 

can be in color or black & white/greyscale. The platform also accepts rotated photos.

Thai National ID Document: The platform accepts both real and photocopied versions of the Thai National ID document. The images 

should be of the card only, without any writing on them.

Document Structure: 

Car Registration Document: The Car Registration document has two pages, with the first page containing vehicle information and the 

second page containing the car owner's personal information. It is mandatory for the platform to receive both pages of the document for 

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to work.

Thai National ID Document: The Thai National ID document should be an image of the card, either real or photocopied.

Document Processing: 

Initial Checking: Upon receiving the documents, the platform will first check for compliance with the document acceptance criteria.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Processing: If the document is accepted, it will undergo OCR processing to extract the relevant 

information.

Data Storage: The processed information will be stored in the platform's database for access and use.

Access and Use: The processed information will be available for access and use by authorized personnel.

Data Validation: The system validates the extracted data to ensure that it is accurate and complete.

API Usage:

POST Ocr image:

Authentication - Admin

METHOD - POST

URL -  /utils/image-ocr  

Content-Type -  multipart/form-data

{

  "file": <file>,

  "file_type": "thai_id", (thai_id/car_registration)

  "affiliate": <affiliate_id> (optional)

}

The above API will return OCR Data Model ID, which can be further used to fetch the data.

GET Ocr image:

Authentication - Admin

METHOD - GET

URL -  /utils/image-ocr/<id>  

DELETE Ocr image:

Authentication - Admin

METHOD - DELETE

URL -  /utils/image-ocr/<id>  

FairdeeQuotationQuery has two new fields introduced  car_registration_ocr_data_id   and  national_id_ocr_data_id , these 

fields are to be populated using create or patch of fairdee-quotation-query API to link ocr data with fqq,

Conclusion:

The technical design documentation for the Car Registration and Thai National ID Document Processing in Appman provides a 

comprehensive outline of the processes involved in accepting and processing these documents. It covers the document acceptance criteria, 

document structure, document processing flow, technical requirements, quality assurance, maintenance, and support. This document 

serves as a guide for the development and deployment of the platform, ensuring its success and optimal performance.
